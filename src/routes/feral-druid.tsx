            <p className="guideIntro">Druid is a shapeshifter class that is fairly unique to World of Warcraft. Their versatility and ability to fill any role (tank, melee, caster, or healer) makes them the true jack of all trades. There are so many different ways to play a Druid that it can morph to a players desired role, that they feel most comfortable with. No matter what your playstyle for hardcore is, there is a build or style that will likely feel comfortable for you. Don't be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of skills and abilities! Druid is easy for beginners with a high skill cap, but there is lots of room in between.</p>
              <p className="guideIntro">This is our recommended talent and starter guide for someone new to the class or having trouble surviving in Hardcore.</p>

They are also excellent kiters in the open world, using Bash, Hibernate, Entangling Roots, and Nature's Grasp. Focus on gear with highest stats overall because every stat is utilized by Druid.</p>

              <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/embed/druid/510005301">See 10-24 Feral Druid Talents</a>
            </div>
            <p>Your first point recommendation is Nature's Grasp. This would be followed by Improved Wrath, Natural Weapons and Omen of Clarity. If you are still dying at low level, an alternative is to max out Improved Natureâ€™s Grasp. Between Levels 25-30 you will be respecing if you took Improved Wrath so make sure to save 1 gold.</p>
            <h4>25-60</h4>
            <div className="guideTalents">
              <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/talent-calc/embed/druid/014005301-5302511303002151-05">See 24-60 Feral Druid Talents</a>
            </div>
            <p>Once you respec you will want to likely run a build similar to this. There are variables here in talent points that will be explained. Once you have your 14 points into the balance tree, you will want to max out Furor (5/5) in the tier 1 resto tree. The benefit of this is any time you enter bear form you will always have enough rage to Bash (stun)  or to Feral Charge (later on), which is incredibly important for making space in hardcore. </p>
            <p>You will want to take 5/5 Ferocity, 2/2 Brutal Impact, 5/5 Thick Hide, Feral Charge, 3/3 Predatory Strikes, 2/2 Savage Fury, Feral Faerie Fire (Quality of Life more than necessary talent) 5/5 Heart of the Wild for your Level 54-58 push when gear gets harder to come by, this will be your powerspike for the final levels. In this build I have 3 points in Feral Aggression but you can place them anywhere you'd prefer - Primal Fury or Blood Frenzy are great choices as well. Feline swiftness is not a necessary talent for this build.</p>

            <h2>Recommended Professions</h2>
            <h4 className="flat">Alchemy/Herbalism</h4>
            <p>Single handedly the most important / viable hardcore profession for Druid.  Druid utilizes every stat and elixirs provide INT AGI STR and STAM as well as regen, absorb potions of different schools of magic, elixir of mongoose and more. Mana potions are much more valuable to a druid than healing potions and alchemy allows you to craft them easily, as these are harder to find on vendors. Druids can pick herbs in form which makes it easy to run around and gather what you need.</p>

                <p><strong>Alliance -</strong> Defeat Lunaclaw and speak to her to gain the strength of heart (Darkshore, Moonkin caves outside Auberdine.) </p>
                <p><strong>Horde -</strong> Defeat Lunaclaw and speak to her to gain the strength of heart ((Barrens, just outside of Camp Taurajo)) </p>

            <h2>Using your forms efficiently</h2>
            <ul className="unstyled">
              <li>
                <h4 className="flat">Cat</h4>
                <p>Due to the toolkit being subpar from level 20-36, Cat form should only be used in single target mobs at level or below that can be bled. Cat form surge of power comes after level 36 when you have the full range of abilities including: Pounce, Ravage, Rip, Rake, Tigerâ€™s Fury and Ferocious Bite.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Kittyweaving -</strong> Using cat form to fish for Omen procs with 1.0 attack speed as it only procs off auto attacks. You can then use your Clearcasting to cast a max rank heal,  Moonfire or any melee ability.</li>
                  <li><strong>Dash - </strong>
                    An incredibly important cooldown that should be saved for dire situations where you need to escape. Keep in mind if you need to shapeshift out of Kat once you use Dash, you lose the speed bonus.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4 className="flat">Bear</h4>
                <p>Due to Thick Hide, Frenzied Regeneration, Feral Charge, Demoralizing Roar and other talents bear is the form youâ€™d be in when you feel unsafe or are fighting multiple adversaries. In a situation where you feel like you need to run, bear form is the default form to use (instead of cat) because of the added health and armor and the ability to create space with bash and feral charge.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4 className="flat">Caster</h4>
                <p>Young Druids (Level 1-25) have Improved Wrath, Moonfire and Roots available to help control situations until Bear form becomes stronger.  Due to the lack of abilities that create rage generation, you want to avoid face tanking mobs with full health.  Many people die at lower levels due to overpulling mobs and not having many outs due to the lack of abilities.</p>

            <p>Druid isnâ€™t incredibly gear or weapon reliant but there is still value to keeping an arsenal of gear in your bags!</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>For Innervate - </strong>You will want a weapon with a lot of Spirit if you can find one (Spirit will increase the amount of mana your regenerate)</li>
              <li><strong>With Natural Weapons - </strong> Your melee weapon can actually do a lot of damage if your weapon skill is up to par for times you get stuck in caster form. You can also regen mana this way while rolling hots on yourself.
              </li>
              <li><strong>While in form - </strong> Druid in form uses maces and staves as "stat sticks" so you donâ€™t have to worry about top end or speed when in forms. You can also use 1 handed daggers, maces and offhands but they are not recommended.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Do not shy away from gear with intellect or spirit because of shapeshifting, spellcasting and health & mana regeneration!</p>
